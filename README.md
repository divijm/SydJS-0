# SydJS(0)

SydJS(0) is a meetup aimed at people wanting to learn and explore Javascript development!

My role was to help mentor the new people by helping them with any issues they had, as we went ahead with using git, Github and through the creation of 2 Javascript apps - TicTacToe and a Todo app.

Split over two days - these are some of the things we had go through:

- Get the laptop ready with an editor - Atom.io or Sublime
- Download Chrome and explore the console environment
- Create a Github account
- Make an initial repository
- Through Atom - create an index.html and styles.css
- Use git and Github to push changes to the Github repo
- Host the index.html file through Github Pages
- Make a JS Fiddle account
- Create a TicTacToe app using html, css and javascript
- Create a Todo app using html, css and javascript
